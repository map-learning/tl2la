# Abstract
Understanding which traffic light controls which lane is crucial to navigate intersections safely.
Autonomous vehicles commonly rely on High Definition (HD) maps that contain information about the assignment of lanes and traffic lights.
The manual provisioning of this information is tedious, expensive and not scalable.
To remedy these issues, our novel approach derives the assignments from motion data automatically and independently of the geometric arrangement.
We show the effectiveness of basic statistical approaches by implementing and evaluating a pattern-based contribution method for this task.
In addition, we propose a falsification method that includes accompanying safety considerations.
Finally, we propose a dataset transformation that enables the use of available motion prediction datasets for semantic map learning.
Our publicly available API for the Lyft Level 5 dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate their own approaches.
